# Artifical-Neural-Network-Optimisation-Using-Evolutionary-Algorithms
Master Thesis Unibas

There are three files with the experiments, Experiment_MNIST, Experiment_Wholesale and Experiment_AD (artifical data).

Before running each of these files the static variables (like maxNeurosn, Inputsize....etc) in the file NeuralNetwork_Batch need to be adjusted. 

Parameters of the mutation operations can be adjusted in the MutationAction file.
